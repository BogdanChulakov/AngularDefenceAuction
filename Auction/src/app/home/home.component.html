        <p >This is an application where everyone can offer their unnecessary things for sale.
            The user can see all the offers sent to the items offered by him and the highest price will be saved as the
            price of the item.
            Also, each user can par- ticipate in auctions of items that he has not created, and can bid repeatedly!</p>
